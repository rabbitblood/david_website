          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Theme For This Project</h3>
            <p>
              the theme for this project is for a friend's photography profile
              website
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Prime Objectives Of the Website</h3>
            <p>
              the goal of building this website is for people to see his
              photography online, and promote himself. there will be a contact
              section where you can send email to him, so he will have better
              chance to get job, or even better if some people wants to buy his
              photography.

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Detailed Analysis Of The Ideal Audience</h3>
            <p>
              I believe the audience of this website will be artist or prople
              who is looking for an artist. Language and gender, or anything
              else shouldnt really be a problem. There wont be photo selling
              section since he is not fully professional into photography yet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Description of the information architecture</h3>
            <p>
              the navigation should be simple, there is the main page for
              general infomation, a photography page to put on all the best
              photography he has shoot for presenting, a about me page for
              information only about himself, and a contact page for giving out
              a way to contact with him.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Illustrate ideas for the pages</h3>
            <p>
              I will build the bare bone of this page for now, without too much
              css. That should be able to be the sketch.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Analyze the competition</h3>
            <p>
              there are many competition website that I have viewd for
              reference:
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://www.demasrusli.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >https://www.demasrusli.com/</a
              >
              this website have a changing background, which pictures are
              stunning and high resolution, I believe this is done by
              javascript, and I should be able to figure out how to do it.
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://chelsea-kauai.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >https://chelsea-kauai.com/</a
              >
              best part about this website is when you scroll down the page,
              background and main content move in a parallel way which add the
              dynamic feeling, I believe this is the javascript changing
              background position relative with OnScroll listener.
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://pierretlambert.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >https://pierretlambert.com/</a
              >
              for this one, my client really like the content layout of it, so
              we will be focusing to having same style of content and layout as
              this website
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>A link to a website that you use regularly</h3>
            <p>
              Speaking of the website I use regularly, it must be Youtube.
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://Youtube.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >https://Youtube.com/</a
              >
              the target of this platform is pretty much for everyone, and that
              is for sure for advertisement earning, and of course its success
              is mostly depends on its content and the algorism. However the
              page layout definitely helped, first the search bar is user
              friendly, very eye catching. since most people only search for
              what they want to watch. it also gives 8 recommend videos in the
              home page for you, most time at least one of them will draw my
              attention.

          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>uses color effectively</h3>
            <p>
              the best color helper for me is coolors.co
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://https://coolors.co/.com/"

              here is one I just generated:
            </p>

            <div style="padding: 5px; display: flex; height: 100px">
              <div style="background-color: #cacf85; flex: 1"></div>
              <div style="background-color: #8cba80; flex: 1"></div>

              <div style="background-color: #514663; flex: 1"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="text_group">
            <h3>Layout I find appealing</h3>
            <p>
              <a
                style="display: block; padding: 10px; line-height: 3rem"
                href="https://chelsea-kauai.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >https://chelsea-kauai.com/</a
              >
              for now the most satisfied website is chelsea-kauai's profile
              website, I do like the layout, the element, and the user
              interaction, I will definitely make some of this website's element
              into my project.
